# DataSpark-Illuminating-Insights-for-Global-Electronics
Project Overview

DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics is a retail analytics project focused on the electronics industry. The aim is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from Global Electronics' data and provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business growth

Problem Statement

As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, the goal is to analyze data from customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates to identify key insights that will enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, and drive overall business growth.

Tools and Technologies
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python: For data cleaning, preparation, and statistical analysis (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

SQL: For data management and querying.

Power BI/Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Business Use Cases:

By analyzing Global Electronics' customer, product, sales, and store data, we aim to identify key insights that will enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and improve sales forecasting. This will help tailor marketing campaigns, develop better products, plan effective promotions, and decide on store expansions and optimizations. Additionally, understanding the impact of currency exchange rates on sales will allow for better international pricing strategies. Overall, these insights will help Global Electronics increase customer satisfaction and drive business growth.

Approach:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
   
     Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

     Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).

     Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).

2.Load Data

   Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.

3.Power BI Visualization
   
   Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.

     
4.Develop 10 SQL Queries

   Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data. 

   These queries should address important business questions and support the analysis steps below.

Results

   The final deliverable will be a comprehensive EDA report for Global Electronics, featuring:

   Clean and integrated datasets.

   In-depth insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, product performance, store operations, and currency impact.

   Visually compelling dashboards in Power BI/Tableau.

   Actionable recommendations for enhancing marketing strategies, optimizing inventory, improving sales forecasting, guiding product development, and informing store expansion decisions.
